# simple-ts-utils

simple-ts-utils is a small TypeScript package that provides utility functions for common actions used in JavaScript and TypeScript web applications.

## Why simple-ts-utils?

Common actions and helper methods in web applications are repeated across codebases. While this seems like a minor inconvenience, it adds up over time. Instead of copying/pasting helper functions and common logic across codebases, simple-ts-utils provides an alternative to cleanup your codebase.

## Getting Started
