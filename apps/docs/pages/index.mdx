# simple-ts-utils

**simple-ts-utils** is a small TypeScript package that provides utility functions for common actions used in JavaScript and TypeScript web applications.

## Why simple-ts-utils?

Common actions and helper methods in web applications are repeated across codebases. While this seems like a minor inconvenience, it adds up over time. Instead of copying/pasting helper functions and common logic across codebases, **simple-ts-utils** provides an alternative to cleanup your codebase.
